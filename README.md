## Employee Data Analysis

Analyzes Employee Data using SQL and SQLAlchemy Queries

During this project, I did a research project about people whom the company, Pewlett Hackard, employed during the 1980s and 1990s. I designed six tables to hold the data from six CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. I performed data modeling, data engineering and data analysis while doing these tasks. First, to model the data, I inspected the CSV files and then sketched an ERD of the tables. This ERD is saved in this folder as ERD.png. Next, I created a table schema for each of the six CSV files, remembering to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints. Then, I imported each CSV file into SQL tables. My table schemata is saved in the file table_schemata.sql.

## Objectives

### Step 1 - Data Modeling

* Create an Entity Relationship Diagram using https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

### Step 2 - Data Engineering

* Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
    * Specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints

[Table Schema](EmployeeSQL/table_schemata.sql).

### Step 3 - Data Analysis

*  Analyze data using a list of queries about the data utilizing select statements and joins

[Data Queries](EmployeeSQL/queries.sql).

### Step 4 - Data Visualization 

* Import the SQL database into Pandas

* Create a bar chart to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees

* Create a bar chart of average salary by title
